# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### **1. What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized framework that allows **agents** (i.e., user-facing interfaces powered by LLMs) to dynamically enrich their responses by injecting **context from external sources**—such as databases, APIs, or document stores.

At its core:

- MCP gives agents the ability to respond with **accurate, real-time, and domain-specific information** that isn't baked into the model's training.
- This is achieved through **context pipelines**: structured flows that retrieve, format, and inject relevant data into the model’s prompt.
- These pipelines are managed by **operators**, which act as intelligent routers that **analyze the query semantically**, determine what context is needed, and label the task before invoking the appropriate tools (e.g., SQL query, vector search, or API call).

> Think of MCP as the system that enables LLMs to “think before they speak,” using the most relevant external data when needed.

### **2. What is the Flow of Model Context Protocol?**

The typical MCP flow involves a collaboration between **agents** and **operators**, structured like this:

1. **User query input**
    
    e.g., “List tier 1 LPs not contacted in 3 months.”
    
2. **Agent passes the query to the operator**
3. **Operator applies semantic analysis**
    - Interprets the query’s meaning and intent
    - Applies **labels** (e.g., "lookup", "search", "summarization") to determine task type
4. **Operator selects tool(s)**
    - Based on labels and semantics, chooses the best-fit retrieval tool(s): SQL, API, embeddings search, etc.
5. **External context is retrieved**
    - Data is pulled and cleaned from relevant sources (structured or unstructured)
6. **Prompt is assembled**
    - The retrieved context is injected into a **labeled prompt template** and sent to the LLM
7. **Agent responds to the user**
    - The model returns an answer that’s grounded in the fetched context

This diagram simplifies the process:

- **User query** is passed to a **thinking layer** (the **operator**)
- The **operator** uses **semantic cues** to decide whether to respond directly or consult the **tool kit**
- Tools retrieve data, which is routed back to **think**
- The model then **responds** via the agent interface

> The key idea is that operators think, and agents speak — with the right data injected at the right time.

### **3. How Does MCP Decide Which Tool to Use?**

The **operator** determines tool selection by:

- **Semantic parsing** of the user query
    
    (e.g., is it a classification, aggregation, or recall task?)
    
- Applying **labels** to the task
    
    (e.g., `search`, `database-query`, `summarize`, etc.)
    
- Matching intent to tool capability
    
    (e.g., use SQL for structured filters, vector DB for similarity, API for real-time info)
    
- Using logic like:
    - Hardcoded rules (`if contains "in last 3 months" → use SQL`)
    - Vector embeddings and similarity scoring
    - Prompt routers or chains (LangChain, RAG)
- Supporting **fallbacks or chaining** of tools, if one source fails or more context is needed

### Summary Table

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent** | User-facing interface that handles conversation flow |
| **Operator** | Backend controller that semantically labels queries and routes them |
| **Labels** | Tags applied by the operator to determine task type |
| **Semantic** | Meaning-based analysis of the query to guide decision-making |
| **Tools** | Data sources (e.g., SQL, web search, vector DB) used to retrieve context |
